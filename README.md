# CMSC624: Database System Architecture and Implementation - Fall 2021

This course is designed to provide students with an in-depth overview of database architectures --- both the mainstream traditional architecture and also more modern architectures that are especially prevalent in cloud implementations. Students will be trained to reason about different architectural choices for different application spaces, and the tradeoffs inherent in these choices. Students will also get experience with building different parts of database systems. Although the main focus of the course will be database systems, the course will also touch on architectural choices in other types of systems --- including file systems and general distributed systems. The course will be designed to assume that students will already have taken an introductory database course such as CMSC 424. Undergraduates that have taken CMSC 424 should feel comfortable taking 624 afterward.

## Learning Goals

This course is designed to prepare you for systems architecture innovation, with a particular focus on database systems. This ability to innovate is critical in both academic and industrial research and also in any technical leadership position you may obtain after you graduate. Over the course of attending the course, you will gain an ability to read, understand, and hopefully critique proposed systems designs, especially those proposed in published technical whitepapers and research publications (e.g., most papers in database conferences like SIGMOD/VLDB/OSDI/SOSP).

A big focus of this class will be "Big Data" systems. By the end of the semester, you will be able to identify flaws (if any) with a proposed design or solution. You should also gain enough familiarity with how big data systems are built to be able to easily start using any of them, and reason about the observed performance of a deployed system.
